# AP Yaml Blender
A Random YAML make for your archipelago games.
Instead of editing one big file, all you have to do is put your yaml on the app, and let the blender do the rest.

Then, you'll be able to download your fresh generated random Yaml.

## I want to make a Random YAML, but i've never done that before
Put your yamls on the blender. Then you'll be able to set the slot name of every game, and their associated weights.

## I already have a Random YAML
Put your random Yaml first.
Then you can put new yamls on the blender to update your random YAML.
Putting an existing game will erase the old one (and, therefore, update the game settings)

## I wanna combine my Random YAML
Then how about putting all of your random YAML into the blender ? Yes they can do that.

## I wanna remove a game
You can remove games on the blender. They will remove the game and their associated triggers.
